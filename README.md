Our role is simply data analysis and data sharing based on the examination of open resources and public postings and we are not claiming or intending to dwell into security matters which are totally out of our reach. Our basic objective is to create a friendly spot where graphics and data could be visible.

DataShield is a data mining podium that analyses public data  published on social media by people who make apology of terrorism.
