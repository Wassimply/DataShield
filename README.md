Technologies

DataShield is currently morphing into a website built using AngularJS, Bootstrap, R , 3jsand Gulp as a build system on top of Node.js. An iOS app is also in the works, and will also be built on top of AngularJS using Cordova and Ionic as a bridge to native APIs. Proud to support open source!

 Mission 
 
In our project, we attempt to monitor and predict terrorist attacks in real time, using query-based estimates as well as social media data. Our analysis is done at big data scale and empowered by Hadoop.

Technical preview open by invitation. Please email Wassim Zoghlami to inquire.
